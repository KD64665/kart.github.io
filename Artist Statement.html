<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<br>
	<p>To be very honest, I never really worried about the "artistic" side of art. I started doing art simply by doodling things that I wanted to draw. Most of the time, that meant cartoon and anime characters, and my own characters, but that's exactly how I started with art.</p> 
<br>
	<p>Personally, I'm not exactly fond of the idea of "high art." I don't believe that art should be something only for critics and rich people to enjoy. I believe that art should be something that everyone can enjoy. Things like games, movies, TV shows are my kind of art. I am a product of the people, and I want to create things FOR the people.</p> 
<br>
	<p>From Digital Art, I hope to diversify my skills, so I can better express what I want to create, gain stronger skills so I could make it into the art industry, and makes more things that people can enjoy.</p>
